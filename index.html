            <p class="blog-post-col-content">     Blogging has been widely used by individuals and businesses for informal postings online. Now, the instructional potential of blogs has been increasingly acknowledged. Blogs can be used as group discussion, peer review and collaborated project. Blogging about a subject is more engaging than simply reading.  


                Benefits of Blogging for Students  
                Promote self-expression  
                Develop analytical thinking 
                Exercise students’ creativity  
                Improve students’ writing skills 
                Encourages the sharing of resources among students and teachers 
                
                Blogging gives students the opportunities to speak their ‘unique voices’. Students can practice their communication and conversation skills when they comment on others’ postings or reply to others’ feedback on their blogs. Blogging can also help students be courteous and thoughtful.  
                Blogging develops students’ analytical thinking and increases learning to a higher level, not merely just “understanding” and "remembering” instructional materials. Before their thoughts can be written down, students need to analyze the subject and then clarify their thoughts about the subject. Then, they need to carefully formulate and stand by their own opinions.

            <p class="blog-post-col-content"> Supermodels may have ruled the world in the 1990s, but today it's the creatives. Everyone wants in on disruptive, viral, [insert your own buzz word here] intersecting worlds of design and technology. Especially the savvy students who are looking for challenging, fun, and economically rewarding professions.

                Design and coding academies are rising to meet these opportunities, but there's a lot of noise swirling around. If you want your academy's message to shout out and reach your prospective students, you need to be using inbound and content marketing.
                
                Fortunately, your creative natures and enterprises are great fits to achieve great results with content marketing and inbound.For a lot of marketing teams, creating quality content on a consistent basis is a big challenge. Not so for design and coding academies. Your faculty and students already create amazing content daily. Student projects, faculty lectures, and documented curricula are all content sources ready to be tapped.
                
                You can video individual lectures from different courses and post clips online. You're naturals for developing some of the best visual content out there. Take some screenshots of the design or coding tools you teach students to use and add some eye-popping captions as a mini-tutorial. Share your faculty's expertise by publishing their work paired with a short back story or interview with that teacher.
                
                Getting creative is your jam. Review the wealth of content your community is already creating through the lens of your content strategy to attract new students. You'll see your opportunities.
